# eLTC - Tokenized Litecoin

ERC20 Litecoin



eLTC will have a supply of 84 million tokens, it’s divisible to 8 decimal places, and you’ll be able to send and receive them just like you can with any other ERC20 Token. An ERC20 version of Litecoin has many advantages over eBTC, Bitcoin and Litecoin, eLTC will be faster, cheaper and more secure than Litecoin. It has the ability to work with smart contracts. We believe that eLTC, when adopted will be a real asset for Ethereum.
